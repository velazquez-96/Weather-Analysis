# Weather Analysis

The first part of the project is focused on visualizing the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator to observe how the weather changes. A series of scatter plots and linear regressions models were made to examine the correlation between latitude vs. variables sucha as: temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.

The second part of the project allows us to establish specific weather conditions, find cities that satisfy this conditions and, identify the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of the coordinates.
